# OrigamiSimulator

![alt text](https://github.com/zzhuyii/OrigamiSimulator/blob/master/04_Documents_Figures/SWOMPS.gif)

Realistic simulation of active origami structures with multi-physics behaviors. 
The package can capture compliant creases, inter-panel contact, heat transfer, large
folding deformation, and electro-thermally actuated creases. The package provides five
different loading methods adn allows users to created customizable loading schemes with 
arbitrary number and sequence of the provided loading methods. 

Please check the package on our group website or my personal website:

**Figure 2.** Demo of Thermal control. Same as above, four checkpoints are given. We input thermal energy into the creases to accomplish gesture transformation. The desired temperature time series is given.

## Main features of the package:

* Provides five different loading simulation methods, inlcuding Newton-Raphson method,
    Displacement controlled method, Generalized displacement controlled method,
    self folding method, and electro-thermal actuation method. 
    
* Allows users to create customizable loading schemes with arbitrary number and 
    sequence of the provided five loading methods. 
    
* Simulates compliant creases in active origami and provides automated Meshing 
    code for compliant creases. (**Figure 3**)

* Simulates inter-panel contact induced mechanical behaviors within origami. (**Figure 4**)

* Simulates heat transfer in origami systems and captures the electro-
    thermo-mechanically coupled actuation of active origami creases. (**Figure 5**)

**Figure 3.** The package allows users to simulate origami systems with compliant creases, which are creases with non-negligible width. 
Using the compliant crease meshing provides more realistic geometry and allows the simulator to capture advanced mechanical behaviors such as bistability
 and multi-physics actuation.

**Figure 4.** The package allows users to simulate global inter-panel contact within the origami. This panel contact model is a physics-based 
frictionless contact model and can give the correponding forcese between the contacting panels.

**Figure 5.** The package allows users to simulate multi-physics based electro-thermal actuation in the origami creases. The package can capture 
the heat transfer of active origami and can calculate the active crease folding due to changing temperature. 

## Using the Code:

PLEASE ADD THE "00_SourceCode" IN TO THE PATH. For standard mechanical simulation 
of origami, please check the selected simulaiton example from the JMR paper and
PRSA paper in "01_MechanicalLoadingExample". For simulation of the folding electro-thermally 
active origami, please check the example codes in "02_ThermalLoadingExample" associated with the IJMS paper. Additional 
tutuorial examples are presented in the "03_SampleCode_Tutorial_IDETC".
